# 🔄 JavaScript Recursion Exercises

A collection of recursive function implementations in JavaScript, built to master the concept of recursion and practice breaking problems into smaller subproblems.

## 🛠️ Functions Included
- `factorial(n)` – compute n!  
- `sumRange(n)` – sum of all integers from 1 to n  
- `power(base, exponent)` – compute base^exponent  
- `productOfArray(arr)` – product of all numbers in an array  
- `fib(n)` – nth Fibonacci number  
- `reverse(str)` – reverse a string  
- `isPalindrome(str)` – check if a string reads the same backward  
- `someRecursive(arr, callback)` – return true if any element passes `callback` test  
- `flatten(arr)` – flatten nested arrays into a single-level array  
- `capitalizeWords(arr)` – capitalize all words in an array of strings  
- `capitalizeFirst(arr)` – capitalize the first letter of each string in an array  
- `nestedEvenSum(obj)` – sum all even numbers in a nested object  
- `stringifyNumbers(obj)` – convert all number values in a nested object to strings  
- `collectStrings(obj)` – collect all string values from a nested object  
- `collectOdds(arr)` – return a new array of only the odd numbers

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **break problems down** into base cases and recursive steps  
- Managing **call stack** and understanding termination conditions  
- Working with **nested data** through recursion (arrays & objects)  
- Writing **pure functions** that don’t rely on external state  
- Debugging recursive logic and tracking parameters through each call

## 📚 Assignment Summary
This assignment from The Odin Project guided me through:
1. Building fundamental recursive functions (factorial, sumRange, power).  
2. Manipulating arrays and strings recursively (reverse, flatten, someRecursive).  
3. Traversing and transforming nested objects via recursion (nestedEvenSum, stringifyNumbers, collectStrings).  
4. Practicing both **helper method** and **pure recursion** patterns.
